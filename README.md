# connect4 with an AI

Run connect4_as_a_game.py to play as a human vs another human (or play yourself!).
Any .py file which says file_ at the start is a function which is used by a main script.

Run save_load_variables__play_AI_vs_human.py to use the biases and weights that I have found as the AI which will play against you the human.
