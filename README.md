# connect4 with an AI

Run connect4_as_a_game.py to play as a human vs another human (or play yourself!).  
Any .py file which says file_ at the start is a function which is used by a main script.

Run save_load_variables__play_AI_vs_human.py to use the biases and weights that I have found as the AI which will play against you the human.

make_training_data_from_AI_vs_AI.py is a function which plays one AI vs another AI.  
They each learn from their mistakes and slowly the weights and biases of each of them improve.  
When the weights and biases have been tuned satisfactorily they can be used in the save_load_variables__play_AI_vs_human.py file to test how good the AI is against a human.
